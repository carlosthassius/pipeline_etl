# Project: Medieval Softwares - Salary Increase for Employees

## Overview:
This project aims to apply knowledge in ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) pipeline to meet the needs of Medieval Softwares. The company wishes to reward its employees who currently earn up to R$ 6,000.00 with a 10% salary increase. The employees' data are stored in a CSV file encompassing detailed information about each team member.

## Challenge:
The challenge of this project is to create an efficient ETL pipeline that is capable of:

### Extraction: Extract the salary data and information of the employees from the CSV file.

### Transformation: Identify and filter the employees who qualify for the salary increase based on the established criterion of R$ 6,000.00 or less monthly salary. Then, calculate the new salary with the 10% increase for these employees.

### Loading: Store the transformation results in a new dataset or update the original CSV file, ensuring that all information is up-to-date.

## Technologies Used:
### Python
### Pandas
### MySQL
### ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

## Results:
This project allows Medieval Softwares to carry out a fair and automated salary increase for its eligible employees, ensuring that all processes are executed with accuracy and efficiency.
